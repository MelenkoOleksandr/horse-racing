# Front-End Developer test task

I implemented a small web app which can display horse betting status.<br/>
You can start the race and make a prediction which horse will win. Every component and function is covered by tests<br/>
You can see the deployed version on heroku through this [Link](https://horse-racing-app.herokuapp.com/) <br/><br/>

### Thanks for the feedback!
